# Unveiling-the-Android-App-Market-Analyzing-Google-Play-Store-Data

## Project Overview

This project focuses on [briefly describe the project goal, e.g., "analyzing customer data for segmentation" or "sentiment analysis using machine learning techniques"]. The key tasks include data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Modeling**: Implementing [e.g., KMeans clustering, Logistic Regression] for solving the problem.
- **Model Evaluation**: Using metrics such as [e.g., silhouette score, accuracy, etc.] to evaluate the performance of the model.
- **Visualization**: Creating plots and charts to visualize data and results.

## Project Structure

- **`Untitled7.ipynb`**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the complete analysis and code.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation for the project.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is [provide dataset description here, e.g., "a collection of Twitter posts with sentiment labels" or "customer demographic and transactional data"]. It includes the following columns:
- **Column 1**: [Describe the column]
- **Column 2**: [Describe the column]

You can replace this with your dataset or download the dataset from [dataset source, if applicable].
